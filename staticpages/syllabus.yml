        * Course Meeting Times
        >* Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session  
        >* Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session  

        * Prerequisites
        >None

        * Text
        >None

        * Goals
        >1. Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers, back substitution, invertibility of A, factorization into A = LU)  
        >2. Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)  
        >3. Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)  
        >4. Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)  
        >5. Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)  
        >6. Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)  
        >7. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)  
        >8. Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x'Ax > 0, applications)  
        >9. Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)  

        * Exams
        >There will be three one-hour exams at class times and a final exam. The use of calculators or notes is not permitted during the exams.
